Thermal Curtains for Doors and Windows,0,"Closing your curtains and blinds at dusk reduces heat loss. This is especially true if your windows are single glazed or not very good double glazing. Using thick thermal curtains, fixed as close to the window as possible, has the biggest effect. Fit a pelmet at the top of the curatins, or fit them tight against the ceiling,to stop heat leaking at the top of the window and make sure they fall to a window cill or the floor at the bottom. If you have a radiator below your window, make sure this isn't covered with the curtains - otherwise heat will just escape out of the window. For maximum efect, you could also velcro seal the curtains to the wall at either side, and at the centre between drapes. If you have glazed or draughty doors, thermal curtains can also help - they're not just for windows!. The cost will depend on the size of the window or door and the fabric chosen.",£35-£150,COMFORT,DIY,N,This is a simple no-brainer. Will still be useful but will make less of a difference where windows are higher performing double-glazed units.
Fabric Draught Excluders,0,"Placing fabric draught excluders at the bottom of doors in your home can help cut down on draughts. You can even make these yourself if you can sew.The cost will depend on whether it's home-made or bought, and what materials are used. It is possible to make these very cheaply with waste and scrap materials.",£10-40 each,COMFORT,DIY,Y,This is a simple no-brainer.
Radiator Panels,0,"Where a radiator is on an external wall, a lot of the heat it emits goes into the wall and escapes to the outside. You can help reduce this effect by fitting reflective radiator panels between it and the wall, which reflect heat back into the room. Make sure the panel is set off the wall, so that heat doesn't directly enter the wall.",£20-40 for a pack of ten panels,COMFORT,DIY,N,"Be aware, the benefits of this are questionable if applied to internal walls or if the panels are not installed correctly (i.e. hard up against the external wall). The gains will be marginal in most cases, but given the low cost, this may be worthwhile."
Radiator Bleeding and Tools,0,"Make sure you're getting the most out of your radiators by removing any trapped air in the system. This will make your radiators warmer, and your heating system more efficient. You can buy tools that help you do this manually. With some types of radiator it may be possible to add an automatic bleed valve - but you'll need one of these for each radiator.",£10 each,COMFORT,DIY or Handyperson,Y,This is another no-brainer - though householders may need some support and guidance on how to achieve it.
Letter boxes,0,"A letter box can be a major cause of draughts and heat loss. Prevent this by fitting a draught-excluding cover. Brush-type covers will prevent some draught, but solid flaps that seal shut unless post is being pushed against them are best.",£35 each,COMFORT,DIY or Handyperson,Y,This is a simple no-brainer.
Cat flaps,0,"Cat flaps and animal doors can be a major cause of draughts and heat loss. Prevent this by making sure your cat-flap closes properly, and doesn't blow open in the wind. You can now buy wind-proof cat-flaps.",£60 each,COMFORT,DIY or Handyperson,N,This is a simple no-brainer.
Keyhole cover,0,Using a small flap to cover keyholes in doors will help reduce draughts.,£10 each,COMFORT,DIY or Handyperson,N,
Open Chimneys,0,"An open chimney above a fire place will be a major asource of heat loss. When it is not being used for a fire, you should block it with a removable chimney draught excluder. These are specially made products that will help reduce draughts and keep heat in, but still allow the chimney to be vented, avoiding damp and condensation problems. They may either be inflatable 'balloons' or pillows, or made out of a vapour permeable material such as sheeps woool.",£20-50,COMFORT,DIY,Y,
Loft - Loft Insulation,1,"Where your roof insulation is at ceiling level, it is possible to simply top this up to keep more heat in. If you have less than 300mm (1 foot) of insulation, topping it up to 400mm can make a big difference. Make sure you don't block any ventilation routes at the eaves, as this can cause condensation problems in a 'cold' roof space - especially where you have an old-style non-breathable roofing membrane below the tiles or slates. If you can, lifting the existing insulation and fitting an air-tight and vapour-check membrane at ceiling level, below the new insulation, will also cut down on draughts and reduce the risk of condensation. Alternatively, make sure the ceiling is sealed from below with plaster in good condition, with all gaps and cracks filled. Laying or fitting a breather membrane over the insulation will also help improve the performance of the insulation, acting as a 'wind barrier'. The cost of this work will depend on size of loft, level of insulation required, and any associated draught-proofing works. (If your insulation is in line with your roof - at sloping rafters in an attic room or similar, or as part of a flat roof - it's more complicated to upgrade the insulation - see below).","£50-700,",COMFORT,DIY or Handyperson,Y,"This is relatively simple, but you need to be aware of unintended consequences. If there are any signs of condensation or damp in the loft space, these need to be investigated and fixed before fitting new insulation. In some houses may also need to be aware of risks like asbestos."
Loft - Loft Insulation (storage),1,"If you need to store things in your loft, make sure you don't crush your loft insulation, as this will make it work less well. You can store things and still have an insulated loft in two ways. Either build a platform over your soft loft insulation, using 'loft legs' or similar with rigid board fixed on top, OR install an area of rigid insulation, that can't be crushed, with board on top. If you are installing some rigid insulation, make it as small an area as possible and do not install above your bathroom. Rigid insulation could trap condensation and could damage your property.",£50-300,COMFORT,DIY or Handyperson,??,"Need to be slightly aware of structural issues here - if the ceiling is bowing, or the celling joists don't look in good condition, it's best not to do this without getting the advice of a structural engineer (or just not doing this). "
Loft - Insulate and draughtproof an existing loft hatch,1,"If your loft hatch doesn't fit very well, and is not insulated, it means there is a 'hole' in your loft insulation. You can correct this by fixing some insulation to the back of an existing loft hatch and draught-proofing around its edge. If you have also made the loft insulation deeper, you may need to build a plywood 'box' around the loft hatch hole to hold the insulation back. You can fit a simple plywood 'lid' on top of this, which acts as a second barrier to heat loss. Just make sure you do this in a way that means you can still access your loft.",£30-60,COMFORT,DIY or Handyperson,N,
Loft - New Loft Hatch,1,"You can replace your old ill-fitting loft hatch with a new insulated and draught-proof version. Fitting one with an integrated ladder can also make access to your loft safer. If you have also made the loft insulation deeper, you may need to build a plywood 'box' around the loft hatch hole to hold the insulation back. You can fit a simple plywood 'lid' on top of this, which acts as a second barrier to heat loss. Just make sure you do this in a way that means you can still access your loft.",£200-300,COMFORT,Handyperson/ Builder (Joiner),,
Windows - Draughtproofing,1,"Draught-proofing your window frames will cut down on draughts - making your home warmer and more comfortable. This is a relatively simply job, with draught-proofing strips simply glued or screwed to the existing frame.",£10 per window,COMFORT,DIY or Handyperson,Y,
Windows - Secondary Glazing,1,"It is possible to fit simple removable secondary glazing inside existing windows.This will cut down on draughts, and also improve the performance of the glazing - especially single glazing. A rigid plastic acyrlic sheet is fixed with magnetic strips - one strip fitted to the sheet, one to the window frame. The plastic sheet can be ordered cut to fit for the size you need, then you simply fix it with the magnetic strips. This means it is also removable in summer.",£30-70 per window,COMFORT,DIY or Handyperson,Y,
Windows - Secondary Glazing (more advanced),1,"It is possible to fit permanent secondary glazing to existing timber windows, using an additional pane of glass held in place by timber beading on the inside face of the window. This requires some joinery skills.You also need to make sure that the existing window is well sealed on the outside, so moisture doesn't enter the void between that and the new pane of glass, causing condensation. You also need to think about how the glazing might be cleaned - fitting removable or openable panels if required.",£70-200 per window,COMFORT,DIY or Handyperson,,
Doors - Draughtproofing (basic),1,"Draught-proofing your door frames will cut down on draughts - making your home warmer and more comfortable. This is a relatively simply job, with draught-proofing strips simply glued or screwed to the existing frame.",£30 per door,COMFORT,DIY or Handyperson,Y,
Doors - Draughtproofing (advanced),1,"For timber doors over 40mm thick, it is possible to add an additional timber rebate to the door, making the route for escaping air harder, by cutting a square section out of the door jamb, and planting a corresponding square bead on the door frame, as well as rubber draught-proofing strips. This will improve the draught-proofing of the door.",£150 per door,COMFORT,Handyperson (Joiner),N,
Doors - entrance lobbies,1,"An entrance lobby to an external door acts as a buffer to outside, helping to cut down on heat loss and draughts, especially if it has a well fitted and draught-proofed door, and if the main door is not very energy efficient. If you don't already have one, you could consider creating one. Make sure it is arranged so access for people with prams and wheelchairs isn't badly affected - you will normally need about 1m between the doors as a minimum, preferably 1.2-1.5m. The cost for this will depend on your choice of door, decorations and accessories. It will also be possible to create an external porch on some houses - but this will probably cost more.",£300 approx.,COMFORT,DIY or Handyperson,N,This will only be possible if there is enough room! You will usually need at least 1.2m of hallway to create a workable lobby.
Floors - draughtproofing,1,"Floors can be a major source of draughts and heat loss - especially suspended timber floors with poorly-laid floorboards with lots of gaps. You can tackle this by draught-proofing the floor. Fill the gaps between floorboards with draught-proofing strips or filler. Pay particular attention to skirting boards and floor edges, filling any gaps and sealing with air-seal tape if possible. If you have a cellar and can get below the floor, you can also seal the floor from below with tapes and even air-seal membranes. If you're prepared to put up with the disruption you can also lift the floor to fully seal it. (If you're going to do this, you could consider adding insulation at the same time - see below). The cost will depend on the level of work done - with lifting the floor and sealing with tapes and membranes being most expensive. This applies to exposed upper floors - above porches and in overhangs - as much as it does to ground floors.",£20-150 for gap fill. More for membranes and tapes.,COMFORT,DIY or Handyperson,N,
Carbon Monoxide Monitor,2,"Carbon Monoxide is a dangerous gas which can make you ill and even kill you if it reaches a high concentration in you home. Make sure you have a carbon monoxide monitor to alert you to this. This is especially important if you have a fuel burning appliance, like a gas fire, gas boiler or woodburner.",£20,AIR QUALITY and SAFETY,DIY,,
Temperature and Humidity Monitor,2,"Ideally the temperatire in your home should be above 16 degrees, and relative humidity should be between 40% and 60% to ensure good indoor air quality and health. If you have a tempartrure and humidity monitor, you can keep track of this.",£10,AIR QUALITY,DIY,,
Extract Ventilation,2,"Fitting an energy efficient low-level continuously running extract to your bathroom or kitchen will help maintain good indorr air quality by removing moisture and polluted air. This is known as decentralised mechanical extract ventilation - and will improve air quality when compared with intermittent extract, which only comes on sporadically.",approx £150 per fan installed,AIR QUALITY,Handyperson (Electrician),,
Clothes Drying - Indoors,2,"Clothes drying adds a significant amount of moisture to the air, which can drive up internal humidity causing issues with condensation and damp. Making sure that if you have to dry your clothes inside you do it somewhere that is well ventilated and warm will help reduce this risk. An old-fashioned ceiling-mounted airer located near extract ventialtion or an opening rooflight, or shelves within an airing cupboard, would both help with this. If this is not possible, then drying clothes near an open window should help. If you have a lot of laundry and limited space, you could consider using an energy efficient electric clothes drier. This won't save you energy, but it will help improve the air quality in your home.",varies,AIR QUALITY,DIY,,
Clothes Drying - Outdoors,2,"When the weather is fine, if you have outdoor space, it is best to dry your clothes outside - on a balcony, in yard or in a garden. Investing in a collapsable clothes airer for this will maximise the use of space and keep things looking neat.",£50,AIR QUALITY,DIY or Handyperson,,
Hot water saving - Water efficient shower head,3,"By reducing the amount of hot water you use, you will also save energy as less will be needed to heat the water. If you regularly use a shower, fitting a low-flow or aerating shower head will help you achieve this - they can cut down the amount of water required by 30-50%, without adversely affecting the performance. How much you save overall will depend on how much you shower, but you should save on water bills as well as heating bills.

Boiler Controls - Central Heating,3,"Make sure the controls for central heating on your boiler are optimised. You may be able to reduce the temperature of the water supplied to your radiators and still be warm, especially in spring and autumn. (Some boilers are fitted with waether compensation that does this automatically). This will help your boiler run more efficiently. If your boiler has a timer on it, you can use this to control when the heating comes on. You can experiment with this until you reach a setting that works well for you and how you live in your home - whether you're there all the time or not - especially if you are able to monitor your real-time energy use at the same time (see below).",no cost,"COST AND CARBON, estimated saving - 5% on heating energy use. ",DIY,Y,"sabing here similar to weather compensation, but likely to be less effective. "
Combi boiler - Hot Water Controls,3,"Make sure you are not heating your hot water more than you need to. Some combination boilers allow you to set the temparture for this. Most uses don't need water to be hotter than 45-55 oC, so if you're making the water hotter than this you'll have to mix it down with cold water, and this will waste energy.",no cost,"COST AND CARBON, estimated saving - 10% on water heating.

Hot water cylinder - Hot Water Control Settings,3,"If you have a system boiler or electiric space heating, and your hot water is supplied from a hot water cylinder heated by a boiler or immersion heater, make sure the controls are set properly. Set the thermostat to 60-65oC, as this is hot enough for most uses, but also to kill legionella (a harmful bacteria). If your tank has a timer, use this to make sure you're only heating water when you need it.",no cost,"COST AND CARBON,estimated saving - 5% on water heating. ",DIY,Y,
Hot water cylinder - New thermostat.,3,"If you have a system boiler or electiric space heating, and your hot water is supplied from a hot water cylinder heated by a boiler or immersion heater, but this has no thermostat or control, you could consider having one fitted.

Thermostatic radiator valves TRVs (Programmable),3,"If you have central heating with radiators, you can contol the amount of heat provided by each radiator by using Thermonstatic Radiator Valves (TRVs). This means you can turn the heating down in rooms you don't use as much, or don't mind being a bit cooler, (like bedrooms), whilst still having enough heat in the rooms you want it. These can be simple manual controls which you simply turn to the level setting you want, though programmable digitail versions are also now available, so you can set each individual radiator to different temperatures at different times.",£10-50 each,"COST AND CARBON,estimated saving - 5% on space heating.

Room thermostat and programmer,3,"If you have central heating, a room thermostat allows you to control the temperature of your home - making sure it reaches the temperature you need it to and no more, so no energy is wasted. Including a programmer with this means you can also control what time your heating comes. Contrary to common myth, it is much more efficient to just have the heating on when you need it than to have it on all the time at a low level.
