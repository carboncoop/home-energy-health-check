INTRODUCTION,"Produced by The Broughton Trust’s Irwell Valley Sustainable Communities Project and the Carbon Coop, this is a practical guide to keeping your home warm and healthy and help save you money through energy efficiency improvements and behavioural changes.

In an ideal world, all of our homes would be warm, free of damp and mould, and inexpensive to run. While this is difficult to achieve, there are steps we can take to improve our homes. This report will support you to do this.

The report has four sections:

1. Your Home
2. Your Health
3. Your Action Plan
4. Your Support

A trained energy assessor will go through these sections with you during their visit to support you understand how you can create a warmer and healthier home, and save money. "
SECTION 1: Your Home,"During the winter months while the heating is on our homes constantly leak heat outside through the walls, floors, windows, roof and through any cracks, gaps or up chimneys.

The image (right) shows where heat is lost in a typical home. The figures for the percentage loss from different parts of the home will be different for every home.

By stopping the draughts and better insulating your home you will lose less heat. This will make your home warmer, and might save you money if you then find you don't need the heating on so much. The Your Action Plan section will look at what practical steps you can take to stop draughts and insulate your home. We also suggest things you might need to do to improve ventilation in your home, that will help to make your home healthier.

There are many behavioural changes you and others in your home can make to reduce the amount of energy you use. Lots of information can be found online.

## Home comfort check

To find out more about your experience of your home, because we all have different ideas around what is and isn’t comfortable, we have a few questions for you. These questions will help the surveyor tailor any recommendations to your needs."
SECTION 2: Your Health,"Your health is affected by your surroundings. If your home is cold, draughty or damp it can make you feel unwell and make some existing conditions worse.

Ideally, the rooms that you live in should be kept between 16oC and 21oC. A minimum of 21oC is recommended for babies and older people, as well as for people with health conditions that make them vulnerable to the cold. This is because low temperatures affect blood flow and can also affect your breathing.

Relative humidity, which is measure of how much water there is in the air, should ideally be kept between 40% and 60%. Humidity has a direct relationship with temperature. If the amount of water in the air doesn’t change, but the temperature goes up, the relative humidity will go down. Similarly, if the temperature goes down, the relative humidity will go up. This means that keeping your home warmer will also help keep the air healthier.

Below 40% relative humidity the air is too dry, and this can irritate your eyes, nose and breathing, as well as encouraging some bugs to grow – though low levels of humidity are rarely a problem in North West England!

Above 60% relative humidity, the air becomes damp. In the warmer months of spring, summer and autumn, higher levels of humidity are unavoidable - as the external humidity is usually higher too, and there isn’t a big difference in the temperature between inside and outside. In the cold months of winter it can be more of a problem. High levels of humidity encourage the growth of dust-mites, which are a trigger for conditions like asthma and eczema.

It can also lead to condensation forming on cold surfaces, like windows and uninsulated areas of wall or ceiling. This can damage the building, but may also encourage mould growth, which in turn can affect your health.

To keep your home healthy it is best to keep it warm and well ventilated. It will be easier to keep your home warm if it is well insulated and draught-proofed. Cutting down on draughts will also make your home more comfortable, so that even at the same level of heating (and the same air-temperature) you will feel warmer. Alongside this you need to make sure the air in your home stays healthy, and within a reasonable range for relative humidity. You can do this by making sure you have planned ventilation. Having planned and controlled ventilation will also help you save energy - so you only use the ventilation you need.

In the next section we make some suggestions of what you can do to help make your home warmer and healthier. "
SECTION 3: Your Action Plan,"This bit of text doesn't get used - we go straight into the improvements text."
SECTION 4: Your Support,"There are local and national services that can support you to save energy, money and improve your home."
